# US Honey Production Data Analysis üêùüçØ

## Project Overview

This project aims to analyze the trends in US honey production across various states over multiple years. Using data visualization and statistical analysis techniques, insights have been derived on honey production, average price, colony count, and stock changes over time. The project is structured to answer key business questions related to honey production using Python libraries such as `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn`.

## Objectives

- **Analyze** the trends in honey production across states and years.
- **Visualize** the yearly production, colony growth, and price trends using various charts and graphs.
- **Provide insights** on which states have performed best in terms of production and value of production.
- **Identify trends** in average honey prices over time and highlight key turning points.

## Key Insights

- **North Dakota** has consistently produced the highest amount of honey, both in terms of production volume and value.
- There is an **upward trend** in honey prices until 2018, followed by a sharp decline.
- The **highest growth in colony count** was observed in 2010, with a growth rate of over 7.5%.
- Over the years, there has been a **declining trend in stocks** and average production.
- **Year 2000** marked the highest production, while **2016** was the best year for honey prices.

## Data Cleaning and Preparation

- Dropped NaN values and irrelevant data.
- Converted columns to appropriate data types (e.g., `year` column to `datetime`).
- Aggregated the data to perform trend analysis over time.
- Grouped the data by state and year to derive insights on production and value.

## KPIs Analyzed

1. **Best Month for Sales** ‚Äì Analyzed to determine the best-performing time for honey production.
2. **Top-Producing States** ‚Äì Identified the states contributing the most to honey production.
3. **Colony Growth Rate** ‚Äì Measured to understand the growth trend of bee colonies over the years.
4. **Stock and Production Trends** ‚Äì Analyzed to observe changes in honey stocks and overall production.
5. **Price Trends** ‚Äì Investigated price trends over the years to spot patterns or irregularities.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: 
  - `pandas` for data manipulation and analysis.
  - `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for data visualization.
  - `numpy` for numerical operations.

## Visualization

- **Line Charts**: To show the trends in production and honey prices.
- **Bar Charts**: To visualize total production and value by state.
- **Scatter Plots**: To compare colony growth rate over time.
